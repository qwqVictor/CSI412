This section contains a high-level data flow diagram, list of routines and brief descriptions and some implementation details.
\subsection{High-level Data Flow Diagram}
Figure 1 shows the high level data flow diagram.

\begin{tabular}{|p{4cm}|p{9cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Function} & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
\texttt{error(const char* msg)} & Displays an error message and terminates the program. \\ \hline
\texttt{makeTXTName(char* filename, char const *suffix, char* destination, int size)} & Modifies the original file name to generate a new name with a given suffix. The new name is stored in the destination buffer. If the original name doesn't end with ".txt", nothing is done. \\ \hline
\texttt{countCharInFile(char* fileName, char c)} & Returns the number of occurrences of a given character in a file. \\ \hline
\texttt{main(int argc, char* argv[])} in \texttt{server.c} & Starts the server process. Parses incoming client requests, executes their corresponding services, and sends back the results. \\ \hline
\texttt{main(int argc, char* argv[])} in \texttt{client.c} & Starts the client process. Establishes the connection with the server, waits for user commands, and sends them to the server. Prints the results returned by the server. \\ \hline

\subsection{Implementation Details}
The program shown above is a shell program that allows the user to input commands and execute them.

The server program is a C program that listens to client requests and provides services based on the type of request it receives. The server program uses the TCP/IP network protocol to communicate with the client program. The server program has two services: \texttt{TO\_UPPER} and \texttt{COUNT}, which respectively convert the contents of a file to uppercase and count the number of occurrences of a specific character in the file.

The server program first creates a socket using the \texttt{socket()} function with the family parameter set to \texttt{AF\_INET} and the type parameter set to \texttt{SOCK\_STREAM}. Then, it binds the socket to a specific address and port using the \texttt{bind()} function. After that, the server program listens for client connections using the \texttt{listen()} function, and it accepts client connections using the \texttt{accept()} function.

Once a client connects to the server program, the server program reads the client's request using the \texttt{read()} function and parses the arguments of the request using the \texttt{strtok()} function. Then, the server program determines the type of service requested by the client based on the first argument of the request, and it performs the requested service.

For the \texttt{TO\_UPPER} service, the server program reads the contents of the file specified in the request, converts the contents to uppercase, and writes the converted contents to a new file with a suffix of "Upper.txt". The server program then sends the contents of the new file back to the client using the \texttt{write()} function.

For the \texttt{COUNT} service, the server program reads the contents of the file specified in the request, counts the number of occurrences of the character specified in the request, and writes the count to a new file with a suffix of "Char.txt". The server program then sends the count back to the client using the \texttt{write()} function.

The client program is a C program that sends requests to the server program and receives the responses from the server program. The client program uses the TCP/IP network protocol to communicate with the server program. The client program has two options: 't' for \texttt{TO\_UPPER} and 'c' for \texttt{COUNT}. The client program prompts the user for the filename and the character (for \texttt{COUNT}) and sends the request to the server program using the \texttt{write()} function.

Once the client sends the request to the server, the client program reads the response from the server using the \texttt{read()} function. For the \texttt{TO\_UPPER} service, the client program receives the contents of the new file sent by the server and displays them to the user. For the \texttt{COUNT} service, the client program receives the count sent by the server and displays it to the user.

\section{Test Documentation}
This section contains the description of test method, and a test result.
\subsection{Test Method}
I run the server and client manually.

\section{User Documentation}
This section contains how to build the program and argument definition.

\subsection{How to run the program}
Make sure that there is a C compiler and GNU make in your environment. \\
Run \texttt{make} to compile the program. \\
And the binary will appear at \texttt{server} and \texttt{client}.

\subsection{Argument Definition}
The server receives 1 argument: listening port. \\
The client receives 2 arguments: connect host and port.
